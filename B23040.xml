            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>And for Reasons; are Humbly offered,</opener>
            <p n="1">1. THat before the abovesaid <hi>Chairs, Stools,</hi> and <hi>Couches,</hi> were generally made and used; there were yearly made and Vended in this Kingdom above five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand dozen of <hi>Set-work,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Turky-work Chairs,</hi> though made in <hi>England,</hi>) and above twenty thousand dozen of <hi>Cloth, Serge, Perpetuanoes, Chamlets, Bays, Kersies, Norwich Cheniis,</hi> and <hi>Kidderminster-Prints,</hi> in the Cases and Coverings; whereof was spent above three thousand Packs of <hi>Wool;</hi> which <hi>Wool</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys at least thirty thousand poor People.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To fit these up for Sale there was expended, above Forty thousand pound <hi>sterling</hi> of <hi>Silk Fringe,</hi> which <hi>Silk</hi> is the Product of our own <hi>Cloth</hi> Exported.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To perfect these for use, there was also expended great quantities of <hi>Nailes, Girt-web, Sack-cloth, Worsted Fringe, Flax, Hemp, Hair,</hi> all of our own Growth and Manufacture; and worth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand of pounds, by which some thousands more of His Majesties Subjects gained their Subsistance.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Great Quantities of these Chairs were Vended and sent yearly beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But since</hi> Cane Chairs, Stools, <hi>and</hi> Couches, <hi>which generally the</hi> Frames <hi>are made of</hi> French Walnut, <hi>and the Seats of</hi> Indian Canes, <hi>are become so much in use; the Consumption of Wool the Growth of this Kingdom,</hi> Silk <hi>and</hi> Russia Leather, <hi>which is the Product of Wool, is greatly decreased; and above 50000 of His Majesties Subjects formerly Employed in the Manufactury thereof, have lost their Emyloyments, to the Ruine of them and there numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore it is most humbly prayed, That such a Clause as is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, may be added to the Bill aforesaid; Nevertheless all is submitted to the Wise determination of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
